                            LONDON: The global Financial Stability Board is closely scrutinising the use of crypto
                            assets
                            during the war in Ukraine after concerns they could be used to evade Western sanctions on
                            Russia.
                            Some crypto exchanges have rejected calls to cut off all Russian users, raising concerns
                            that crypto could be used as a way to circumvent sanctions.



                            The crypto sector is on the defensive amid warnings from U.S. and European lawmakers that
                            digital asset companies are not up to the task of complying with Western financial sanctions
                            imposed on Russia following the country's invasion of Ukraine.

                            Cryptocurrency industry leaders are mulling moving court over reduction of taxes, according
                            to
                            a report.

                            Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman last month announced that cryptocurrencies would be
                            subject to a 30% capital gains tax, a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS), no loss offsetting,
                            and taxes on gifts.

                            As reported by CoinDesk, an unnamed executive of a major crypto exchange said: â€œIt seems so.


                            The industry has been pressing for tax reductions during informal negotiations with the
                            government. Several such encounters with decision-makers were verified by executives from
                            other exchanges.
